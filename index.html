        <p id="intro"> I am currently a first-year Information Systems major at CMU. Outside of the academic setting, I typically read novels, watch anime, or hang out with my friends. Additionally, I love trying out new experiences, whether it may be through an event or opportunity. I am also a big foodie, so I love trying out new restaurants or grabbing something quick with my friends. I look forward to my four years at CMU, where I can enjoy the college experience.</p>
